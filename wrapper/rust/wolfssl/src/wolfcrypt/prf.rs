/*!
This module provides a Rust wrapper for the wolfCrypt library's Pseudo Random
Function (PRF) functionality.

It leverages the `wolfssl-sys` crate for low-level FFI bindings, encapsulating
the raw C functions in a memory-safe and easy-to-use Rust API.

/// Pseudo Random Function for MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// * `secret`: Secret key.
/// * `seed`: Seed.
/// * `hash_type`: PRF Hash type, one of `PRF_HASH_*`.
/// * `heap`: Heap hint.
/// * `dev_id` Device ID to use with crypto callbacks or async hardware.
///   Set to INVALID_DEVID (-2) if not used.
/// * `dout`: Output buffer.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Returns either Ok(()) on success or Err(e) containing the wolfSSL
/// library error code value.
///
